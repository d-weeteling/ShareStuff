# ShareStuff
A Firefox plugin to easily share links. 

With this plugin you canshare links with (groups of) friends in a minimal fashion, i.e. without leaving the page you want to share.
It is based on Mozilla webextensions: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions 

The plugin is initially made for Firefox (v45+), and will soon be compatible for Chrome/Chromium (v??), Opera (v??) and even Microshaft Edge.
